                        I'm Benjamin Tousifar, a frontend developer with a unique journey that combines 
                        engineering precision with creative problem-solving. After graduating from UC San Diego 
                        in 2021 with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I spent three years 
                        as a data engineer before discovering my true passion: building beautiful, 
                        functional websites.

                    <p>
                        What excites me most about web development is the art of putting pieces together—taking 
                        individual components, technologies, and ideas, then assembling them into something 
                        larger and meaningful that users can interact with. There's something deeply satisfying 
                        about solving complex problems through code and seeing your solutions come to life 
                        in the browser.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        With five years of coding experience and three years in the tech industry, I bring 
                        both technical depth and real-world project experience to my development work. 
                        I'm currently sharpening my frontend skills through The Odin Project while building 
                        responsive, user-friendly applications with React and modern JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding, you'll find me watching movies, following soccer, or diving 
                        into video games—all of which feed my appreciation for good user experiences and 
                        storytelling through digital mediums.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I'm actively seeking a frontend developer position where I can contribute to 
                        meaningful projects and continue growing as a developer. Let's build something 
                        amazing together!
